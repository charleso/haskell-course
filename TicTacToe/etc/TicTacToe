TicTacToe
=========

* Build with CABAL
  * TicTacToe.cabal
  * Setup.hs

* Should be thoroughly tested
  * Consider using:
    * QuickCheck
    * HUnit
    * test-framework

* Expose appropriate API e.g. (type signatures are approximate)
  * isWin :: Board -> Bool
  * move :: Position -> Board -> Board
  * disallow invalid board state /using the type system/
    * cannot move on a board that has completed (type error)
    * attempting an invalid move (e.g. position occupied) does not produce a board with which to continue

* API documented using Haddock
  * http://www.haskell.org/haddock/doc/html/index.html

* Code style examined using hlint
  * cabal install hlint
  * Produce a report (--report)

* Interactive play using API
  * Two player game at the console


* Extra-curricular
  * Write an opponent that never loses
* Extra-Extra-curricular
  * Write an opponent with easy, medium, hard difficulty levels

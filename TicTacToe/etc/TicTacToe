* Build with CABAL
  * TicTacToe.cabal
  * Setup.hs
* Should be thoroughly tested
  * Consider using:
    * QuickCheck
    * HUnit
    * test-framework
* Should be documented using Haddock
  * http://www.haskell.org/haddock/doc/html/index.html
* Expose appropriate API e.g. (approximate)
  * isWin :: Board -> Bool
  * move :: Position -> Board -> Board
  * disallow invalid board state /using the type system/ e.g. cannot move to a board that already has a winning position
* Extra-curricular

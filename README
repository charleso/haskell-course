Haskell Course
==============
Written by Tony Morris 2010
---------------------------


The course is structured according to a linear progression and uses
the Haskell programming language to learn advanced programming concepts.
Module L[N] must be completed before module L[N+1] unless otherwise stated.
The existing code compiles and exercises have been completed.
However, a script is used to wipe the answers to the exercises,
leaving a compilable source file.
This script is available in the Answers.Replace module and accepts one
or more file names.

It is recommended that the student branches the existing code and commits their
answer as they proceed through each exercise.

For example:
hg branch student-name
hg commit -m "Finished Exercise 1 of module L03 (tests pass)"
